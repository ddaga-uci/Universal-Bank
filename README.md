# Universal-Bank
Analyzing customer data to see if the offer from from Universal Bank will be accepted or rejected by customers.

Purpose
Universal Bank seeks to determine which current customers are likely to accept an offer to purchase an additional financial product (a personal loan).  The assignment focuses on gaining insight into the Universal Bank data set and creating simple prediction models.

Data Set
The data file included with this assignment is a list of current customers of Universal Bank.  A binary (0/1) variable, “Acpt_Offer”, indicates those customers that accepted the bank’s solicitation for a financial product (a personal loan) in a recent solicitation (a “1” indicates that customer accepted loan offer and “0” if not).  

A set of demographic and customer-product variables are included in the file.  The description of these variables is found in the second tab of the Excel data file.  There is also a .csv file (comma separated value) with the same data which could be used for the analysis in R.
